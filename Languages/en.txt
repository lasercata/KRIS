Cracker is a software developed and updated by Lasercata and by Elerias. It is written in Python 3 and in C.
This software is a toolbox application that enables you to do many things : you can encrypt securely a secret message using one of the many ciphers present in Cracker (KRIS, AES, RSA, ...), sign it with a hash function, decrypt it.
If you have a message without the key, but you need to read the content, you can try to crack it using a wordlist that you made with Cracker, or let the algorithm try to crack it using its wordlist bank.
You don't remember which was your favourite wordlist ? Don't worry ! You can analyze them with the wordlist tab to get numerous informations on them.
You need to convert a number from binary to hexadecimal ? You need to do a special conversion using your own base alphabet ? Check the "Base convert" tab.
As you can see, there is a lot of functions, often about cracking. But Cracker can also help to improve your security : if you need a strong password, hard to be cracked by brute-force, the "P@ssw0rd_Test0r" tab is for you ! It gives a lot of informations about the password you entered, like its entropy.

About
More information on the GitHub repository
KRIS is a simple software that allow to encrypt some text. The UI is in three main parts : the text editor (at center), the cipher toolbar (top), and the output (bottom).
In KRIS, there are three types of cryptographic function : the symetric ciphers, the asymetric ciphers, and the hash functions.
The symetric ciphers (AES-256, AES-192, AES-256) use the same key to encrypt and decrypt. They are faster than the asymetric ciphers (RSA).
The asymetric ciphers uses key pairs : one public and available key to encrypt, and one private and safely kept key to decrypt. With these ciphers, anyone can send an encrypted message to a person, and only that person can decrypt it. It is not needed to share a secret (the key) with the recipent. Since RSA is a lot slower than AES, KRIS cipher is a mix of both : it generate a random AES key, encrypt the message with this key, and encrypt the AES key with RSA.
The hash functions calculate a unique fingerprint for every text. The output has a fixed length, and totaly changes if there is even a small change in the input. It is not possible to get the clear text from a hash (or try to hash word per word). It is used to check the integrity of documents, and to store passwords.
Encryption
To encrypt some text, first select the cipher (in the cipher toolbar, at right), and then choose your key. You can thereafter press the Encrypt button, or use the shortcut Ctrl+E. The output appears in the bottom text viewer.
Decryption
To decrypt text, simply paste the cipher text in the text editor, and if it is formatted, you can just press the button Decrypt (or use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+E). The cipher and key is automaticly detected if the cipher is `KRIS-*` or `RSA`. Otherwise, you need to select the cipher and enter the key before clicking on Decrypt.
File menu
The File menu allow you to open and save text documents. The input and output parts are saved in different files (Ctrl+S to save input (main editor), Ctrl+D to save output).
Edit menu
The Edit menu allow you to undo (Ctrl+Z) and redo (Ctrl+Shit+Z) actions in the editor. You can also swap texts (Ctrl+W) to toggle input and output texts, clear output, activate or not Formatted Output (set the output text in a good form) and Auto Decrypt (automaticly detect cipher and key while decrypting).
View menu
The View menu allow you to show or hide the output text, and to resize the window to its original size.
Keys menu
The Keys menu allow you to manage your RSA keys. You can get information on them (Ctrl+I), generate new ones (Ctrl+G), export the public key to share it (the file to share is in `KRIS/Data/RSA_keys` directory, with the extention `.pbk-h` or `.pbk-d`), rename keys.
